# Short

Short is a p5js-like library I am making because of my never ending boredom.

Examples can be found in the `src/examples` directory.

It's still not complete, so expect potential breaking changes.

# When downloading the repository (this is more for me):

## Install all npm packages

Done with `npm i`

## Build project

Done with `npm run build`

## Seeing the results

If you have vscode, just use live server.
If not, just open the html file with your browser of choice and keep refreshing the page when you make changes.
